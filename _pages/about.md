Hello, I am Ahmed Salem, I am a Postdoc researcher at Microsoft research (MSR). Previous i was a PhD candidate working in the group of [Michael Backes](https://cispa.de/en/about/director-page) at CISPA, Saarland University.

My research interests are mainly: Machine learning privacy, biomedical data's privacy and applied cryptography.
